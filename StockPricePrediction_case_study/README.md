# Stock Price Prediction

### Overview:
This project aims to predict the stock price of an asset to be specific the weekly return of Tesla stock using a supervised regression framework. By incorporating both Tesla's historical data and the performance of potentially correlated assets, this case study explores how external factors influence Tesla's stock price. This comprehensive approach leverages financial and economic data to gain insights into the dynamics of Tesla's market performance.

## Aim
The primary objective of this project is to build a regression model that accurately predicts Tesla's weekly returns based on a variety of independent variables, including other stocks, currency exchange rates, and market indices. This understanding can assist investors and analysts in making informed decisions about Tesla's stock.


# Importance of the Model
- **Insight Generation:** Understanding the factors that influence Tesla's stock price provides actionable insights for investors and stakeholders.
- **Risk Management:** A predictive model helps in mitigating investment risks by anticipating potential fluctuations in stock returns.
- **Portfolio Optimization:** By recognizing correlated assets, the model can inform diversification strategies to enhance portfolio performance.
# Technologies Used
- **Python:** For data preprocessing, feature engineering, and model development.
- **Data Analysis:** Libraries like Pandas and NumPy for handling and analyzing financial datasets.
- **Visualization:** Matplotlib and Seaborn for plotting trends, correlations, and model performance metrics.
- **Machine Learning**: Scikit-learn for implementing regression models to predict Tesla's weekly stock returns.
- **Time Series Analysis:** Techniques to handle historical stock data and ensure temporal integrity in model training and testing.
## Key Highlights
- **Feature Engineering:** Transformation and scaling of financial and economic indicators for optimal model performance.
- **Correlation Analysis:** Assessment of relationships between Tesla's returns and other independent variables.
- **Model Validation:** Rigorous testing of regression models using cross-validation techniques.


This repository demonstrates a methodical approach to leveraging machine learning for stock price prediction, with a focus on Tesla, while incorporating real-world financial data to enhance model accuracy and relevance.
