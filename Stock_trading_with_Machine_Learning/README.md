# Stock Trading with Machine Learning

This project leverages Machine Learning to develop and analyze a stock trading strategy, focusing on predictive modeling and performance evaluation. The goal is to enhance decision-making in financial markets by combining data-driven techniques with practical trading insights.

## Overview

Stock trading involves predicting market trends and executing trades to maximize returns while managing risk. This project applies machine learning models to historical stock price data to generate trade signals and evaluate their effectiveness. Key performance metrics such as cumulative returns, Sharpe ratios, and drawdowns are analyzed to measure the strategy's success compared to a benchmark.

In this project, we:

- Build and train machine learning models for predicting stock price movements.
- Generate buy/sell signals based on predictive models.
- Evaluate the strategyâ€™s performance using financial metrics and compare it to a benchmark.
- Analyze and visualize key trading metrics such as cumulative returns, risk-adjusted returns, and drawdowns.

## Features

- **Data Processing**:
  - Load and preprocess historical stock price data.
  - Perform feature engineering to enhance predictive accuracy.

- **Signal Generation**:
  - Train machine learning models to predict market trends.
  - Develop a rule-based system to generate buy/sell signals.

- **Performance Analysis**:
  - Compute cumulative returns, Sharpe ratios, Sortino ratios, and maximum drawdowns.
  - Compare the performance of the strategy against a benchmark.

- **Visualization**:
  - Plot cumulative returns and performance metrics over the trading period.
  - Visualize key risk and return statistics.

## Tools and Libraries

The project utilizes the following tools:

- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Libraries**:
  - `NumPy`: Mathematical and statistical operations.
  - `Pandas`: Data manipulation and analysis.
  - `Matplotlib` and `Seaborn`: Data visualization.
  - `scikit-learn`: Machine learning model training and evaluation.
  - `yfinance`: Fetching historical stock price data.
  - `QuantStats`: Portfolio and performance analysis.

This project showcases the power of machine learning in stock trading, emphasizing practical implementation and robust performance evaluation. It highlights how data-driven approaches can improve trading strategies in financial markets.
