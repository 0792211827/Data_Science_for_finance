# Portfolio Optimization with the Markowitz Model  

This project explores **Portfolio Optimization** using the **Markowitz Mean-Variance Optimization Model**, a groundbreaking framework in modern finance. The goal is to construct an efficient portfolio that maximizes returns while minimizing risk, leveraging the balance between expected return and portfolio variance.

---

## Overview  
Investors aim to maximize returns while minimizing risk. This trade-off forms the basis of portfolio optimization. The Markowitz Mean-Variance Optimization Model provides a systematic method to achieve this by identifying portfolios on the **Efficient Frontier**, where no higher return can be achieved for a given level of risk.

In this project, we:
- Implement the **Markowitz Model** for portfolio optimization.
- Explore key financial metrics like **expected returns**, **covariance matrices**, and **Sharpe ratios**.
- Visualize the **Efficient Frontier** and analyze optimal portfolios for different risk tolerance levels.

## Features  
- **Data Processing:** Load and preprocess historical stock price data.  
- **Portfolio Simulation:** Simulate thousands of portfolio combinations to identify the Efficient Frontier.  
- **Risk-Return Analysis:** Calculate portfolio metrics, including:
  - Expected return
  - Portfolio variance and standard deviation
  - Sharpe ratio  
- **Visualization:** Plot the Efficient Frontier and optimal portfolios for different risk preferences.
